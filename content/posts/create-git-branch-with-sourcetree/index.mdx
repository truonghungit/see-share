To create a new Git branch in Sourcetree, you will simply click on branch button then enter the branch name

**ProTip**: Sourcetree will automatically checkout the branch for you immediately after the branch has been created, so you can get straight to work on the right file.
If you don't want to checkout new branch, uncheck the checkbox **Checkout New Branch**
