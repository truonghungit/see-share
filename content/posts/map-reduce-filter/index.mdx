**map, filter and reduce** are essentially just some of the most well-known, easy to use, higher-order functions that run provided callback on each element of an array.

**In this article,** we will explore how using **map()**, **filter()**, and **reduce()** can help make our code:
1. Easy to comprehend.
2. Less prone to side effects as these function don’t modify the actual array, and instead create a new one.
3. Avoid explicit loops.

Let’s explore and familiarize ourselves with these functions.

#### Array.map()

The map() method is used for creating a **new array** from an existing one, applying a function to **each one of the elements** of the first array.

##### Syntax

```js
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
```

The map() method accepts two parameters:

- `function(currentValue, index, arr)`: This is a required parameter that runs on each element of array. It contains three parameters: currentValue, index and arr.
- `thisValue`: This parameter is optional. It holds the value of passed to the function.

When you call **map** on an array, it executes that callback on every element within it, returning **a new array** with all of the values that the callback returned.

```js
// What you have
var users = [
  { id: 20, name: "Captain Piett" },
  { id: 24, name: "General Veers" },
  { id: 56, name: "Admiral Ozzel" },
  { id: 88, name: "Commander Jerjerrod" },
];
// What you need
[20, 24, 56, 88];
```

There are multiple ways to achieve this. You might want to do it by creating an empty array, then using `.forEach()` or a simple `.for()` to meet your goal.

Using `.forEach()`:

```js
var usersIds = [];
usersIds.forEach(function (user) {
  usersIds.push(user.id);
});
```

We have to create an empty array to contain the return result as a new array when using `forEach()` like above, but when we using `map()`:

```js
var usersIds = users.map(function (user) {
  return user.id;
});
```

With arrow functions (requires ES6 support, Babel or TypeScript):

```js
const officersIds = officers.map((officer) => officer.id);
```

So how does `.map()` work?
Basically is takes 2 arguments, a callback and an optional context (will be considered as **this** in the callback). The callback runs for each value in the array and returns each new value in the resulting array.

> **Notes:** You can see that the map method maps the arrow function to each element and returns a new array which has the same length as the original array. The original array remains unchanged.

#### Array.filter()

What if you have an array, but only want some of the elements in it? That’s where `.filter()` comes in!

##### Syntax

`arrayObject.filter(callback, contextObject);`

The syntax for filter is similar to map, except the callback function should return **true** to keep the element, or **false** otherwise. In the callback, only the element is **required**.

Here’s our example, we have an array like this:

```js
var users = [
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Wedge Antilles",
    age: 28,
    gender: "Male"
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    name: "Ciena Ree",
    age: 40,
    gender: "Female"
  },
  {
    id: 40,
    name: "Iden Versio",
    age: 31,
    gender: "Male"
  },
  {
    id: 66,
    name: "Thane Kyrell",
    age: 20,
    faction: "Female",
  }
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 45,
    faction: "Male",
  }
];
```

So, we want two arrays like: one for users have gender is Female, the other one for Male. With .filter() it couldn’t be easier!

```js
var females = users.filter(function (user) {
  return user.gender === "Female";
});

var males = users.filter(function (user) {
  return user.gender === "Male";
});
```

That’s it! And it’s even shorter with arrow functions:

```js
const females = users.filter((user) => user.gender === "Female");
const males = users.filter((user) => user.gender === "Male");
```

In the next example, `filter()` is used to get all the users whose age are greater than or equal to 35.

```js
const userAges = users.filter((user) => user.age >= 35);
return userAges;
```

Basically, if the callback function returns true, the current element will be in the resulting array. If it returns false, it won’t be.

#### Array.reduce()

Just like `.map()`, `.reduce()` also runs a callback for each element of an array. What’s different here is that reduce passes the result of this callback (the accumulator) from one array element to the other.

##### Syntax

`arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])`

The **callback** argument is a function that will be called once for every item in the array. This function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used.

- accumulator - the returned value of the previous iteration
- currentValue - the current item in the array
- index - the index of the current item
- array - the original array on which reduce was called
- The **initialValue** argument is optional. If provided, it will be used as the initial accumulator value in the first call to the callback function.

Time for an example! Say you have an array with these employees and their respective years of experience:

```js
var employees = [
  {
    id: 10,
    name: "Poe Dameron",
    years: 14,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Temmin 'Snap' Wexley",
    years: 30,
  },
  {
    id: 41,
    name: "Tallissan Lintra",
    years: 16,
  },
  {
    id: 99,
    name: "Ello Asty",
    years: 22,
  },
];
```

We need to know the total years of experience of all of them. With `.reduce()`, it’s pretty straightforward:

```js
var totalYears = employees.reduce(function (accumulator, employee) {
  return accumulator + employee.years;
}, 0);
```

With arrow functions, we would write it like this:

```js
var totalYears = employees.reduce((accumulator, employee) => {
  return accumulator + employee.years;
}, 0);
```

First, we call `reduce` on our list of numbers. We pass it a callback, which accepts the previous value and current value as arguments, and returns the result of adding them together. Since we passed `0` as a second argument to reduce, it'll use that as the value of previous on the first iteration.

> Notice that the callback gets a previous value on each iteration. On the first iteration, there is no previous value. This is why you have the option to pass reduce an initial value: It acts as the "previous value" for the first iteration, when there otherwise wouldn't be one.

Now we want to find which employee is the most experienced one. For that, I can use reduce as well:

```js
var mostExpEmployee = employees.reduce((oldest, employee) => {
  return (oldest.years || 0) > employee.years ? oldest : employee;
}, {});
```

My accumulator named `oldest`. My callback compares the accumulator to each employee. If a employee has more years of experience than `oldest`, then that employee becomes the new `oldest` so that’s the one I return.

As you can see, using `.reduce()` is an easy way to generate a single value or object from an array.

#### Combining .map(), .reduce(), and .filter()

Since all three are called on arrays and since `.map()` and `.filter()` both return arrays, we can easily chain our calls.

Let’s check out another example:

```js
var personnel = [
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "Luke Skywalker",
    pilotingScore: 98,
    shootingScore: 56,
    isForceUser: true,
  },
  {
    id: 82,
    name: "Sabine Wren",
    pilotingScore: 73,
    shootingScore: 99,
    isForceUser: false,
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    name: "Zeb Orellios",
    pilotingScore: 20,
    shootingScore: 59,
    isForceUser: false,
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    name: "Ezra Bridger",
    pilotingScore: 43,
    shootingScore: 67,
    isForceUser: true,
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    name: "Caleb Dume",
    pilotingScore: 71,
    shootingScore: 85,
    isForceUser: true,
  },
];
```

Our objective: get the total score of force users only. Let’s do it step by step!

First, we need to filter out the personnel who can’t use the force:

```js
var jediPersonnel = personnel.filter(function (person) {
  return person.isForceUser;
});

// Result: [{...}, {...}, {...}] (Luke, Ezra and Caleb)
```

With that we have 3 elements left in our resulting array. We now need to create an array containing the total score of each Jedi.

```js
var jediScores = jediPersonnel.map(function (jedi) {
  return jedi.pilotingScore + jedi.shootingScore;
});
// Result: [154, 110, 156]
```

And let’s use reduce to get the total:

```js
var totalJediScore = jediScores.reduce(function (acc, score) {
  return acc + score;
}, 0);
// Result: 420
```

And now we can chain all of this to get what we want in a single line:

```js
var totalJediScore = personnel
  .filter(function (person) {
    return person.isForceUser;
  })
  .map(function (jedi) {
    return jedi.pilotingScore + jedi.shootingScore;
  })
  .reduce(function (acc, score) {
    return acc + score;
  }, 0);
```

And look how pretty it is with arrow functions:

```js
const totalJediScore = personnel
  .filter((person) => person.isForceUser)
  .map((jedi) => jedi.pilotingScore + jedi.shootingScore)
  .reduce((acc, score) => acc + score, 0);
```

>Note: In my previous example, .map() and .filter() weren’t even necessary. We could easily achieve the same result with only .reduce().

#### Try it!
Try to replace some of your `for` loops with `.map()`, `.reduce()`, `.filter()` where it seems to fit. You’ll find it simpler to test the functions you call with .map(), .reduce(), or .filter() if you write unit tests for your code.

Enjoy coding!
